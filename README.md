## Servo-motor controller for MotoCoco ATiny85

Motococo is a multi-use board based on the ATiny85 microcontroller using audiobootloader for the programming it. It has two servo-motor ports, analog sensor input, Neopixel output with three places for the 5050 footprint Neopixels and a solder point for audio out.

The reason for making the Motococo board was to imporve my skills in the Inkscape-Kicad PCB-process and get few servo-motor controllers for a "Information Physicalisation" workshop, as a part of TAxT Hello World Art & Technology Festival in Taoyuan Arts Center October 2017.

##The TAxT workshop
(No-code, mechanics workshop)

##Continuation
(Mörkö?)

This is my second second board based on the ATiny85 microcontroller and the audiobootloader and continuation of geeking residencies and workshops in Dimensionplus, Taipei Taiwan. The board design is based on the 8Bitmixtape project and Marc Dusjagr Dusseliers workshopology around DIY PCB and the development of the 8Bitmixtape.

The best starting point for familiarising on the hardware and the software is from 8Bitmixtape wiki:
